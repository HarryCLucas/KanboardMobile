# KanboardMobile
An Apache Cordova mobile app that connects to the open source Kanboard System. 

I created this app as an effort to make the Kanboard Todo system useful to a new demographic of users. It seemed like a lot of people were staying away due to lack of a mobile app, so I figured that a publicly released one would be handy. 

The app is built on Apache Cordova and should compile to iOS, Windows Phone and Android. The Remember Me functionality securely stores login details and the app communicates with a specified server through Kanboard's JSON RPC.

As of writing, iOS is untested, but Windows Phone and Android are functional. The App is currently available on the Google Play store.
